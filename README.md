# Workshop description:

During the workshop, I'd like to present the most important aspects of RN and how to develop the mobile app using this framework with ease and using good patterns and practices.

The main goal of the workshop will be to go through the whole process of development and building the app to track personal expenses.

During this workshop, we will create projects using these two methods so it's very important to
had everything properly configured on your computer before the workshop start.
